**Weaknesses**: Since I started my career as developer, I tended to focus too much on the technical details and solutions when I faced a problem. However, in the some situation,  the best solution or the most suitable solution may not be a technical solution. and It might be better to solve some problems by communication with users or discussion with team members. I became aware of this weakness. So Nowadays when the problem surfaced, instead of focusing only on the technical aspects, I explore more about the problem.  i.e  what is the root cause of the problem, what does the user really want?  what are the other impacts or risks to make the change.  Instead of getting things done quickly, I learned to do the right thing and to do the things right.
